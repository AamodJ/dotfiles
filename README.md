This rice is mostly copied from [GuardKenzie's rice](https://github.com/GuardKenzie/kastali). There are a number of dependencies for this rice, but all of them can be installed with the `install-arch.sh` script. Simply clone this repo and run the script. Note that this installation currently assumes that you're cloning the repo in a dedicated `~/git-clones` directory. Also note that there are a number of things the install script does that is specific to fixing a few things on the 2018 macbook pro (4x thunderbolt ports). If you wish to install this rice on another machine, simply remove the mac specific lines from the install script. Cheers!
